# swift-weather-ui
An attempt to build a SwiftUI version of the [Buluttan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buluttan/id1169456055) weather app. During the process, we will hopefully create some reusable weather-related views that can be used from other projects.

The other goal is to note down experiences and challenges during the UIKit to SwiftUI conversion.
