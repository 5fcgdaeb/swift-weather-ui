# swift-weather-ui
An attempt to build a SwiftUI version of the [Buluttan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buluttan/id1169456055) weather app. During the process, we will hopefully create some reusable weather-related views that can be used from other projects.

The other goal is to note down experiences and challenges during the UIKit to SwiftUI conversion.

## Buluttan Screens To Convert

### The Main UI
![](https://github.com/5fcgdaeb/swift-weather-ui/blob/master/460x0w.png "Main UI")

We can create 3 different SwiftUI views from this main UI:
1. Top Header Navigation View
2. Weather Current Conditions View
3. Hourly / Daily Forecasts View
